# CPU
    Instr table: http://www.z80.info/z80sean.txt
    Clock: 3.125 MHz (50/16), 1 tick = 320ns
    HALT: wait for interrupt
    Interrupt:
        IFF1, IFF2
        Maskable:
            PC -> (SP)
            PC = irq routine
            RETI ( reload PC )
        NMI:
            PC -> (SP)
            PC = (66H)
            RETN ( reload PC )
        IM 0: opcode from bus
        IM 1: (38H)
        IM 2: address from bus, then JP (I << 8 + address) [not used by TVC]
    Reset:
        IFF1, IFF2 = 0
        IM 0
        R = 0
        I = 0
    Reqisters:
        F: S Z Y H X P/V N C
            S: Set if the 2-complement value is negative. It's simply a copy of the most signiÂ¯cant bit.
            Z: Set if the result is zero.
            Y: A copy of bit 5 of the result.
            H: The half-carry of an addition/subtraction (from bit 3 to 4). Needed for BCD correction with DAA.
            X: A copy of bit 3 of the result.
            P: This can either be the parity of the result (PF), or the 2-compliment signed overflow (VF): set if 2-compliment value doesn't fit in the register.
            N: Shows whether the last operation was an addition (0) or an subtraction (1). This information is needed for DAA.
            C: The carry flag, set if there was a carry after the most significant bit.
        I: interrupt table address upper half
        R: 7 bit counter, increment on each op
        SP: stack pointer, decreases on write, increases on read
